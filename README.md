ðŸŒ¿ Project Title: Sugarcane Leaf Disease Detection Using Deep Learning

This project focuses on identifying diseases in sugarcane leaves using a deep learning model. By analyzing images of sugarcane leaves, the model predicts whether the leaf is healthy or infected. It helps farmers and agricultural professionals detect plant diseases early and take preventive action to avoid crop loss.
The model is built using DenseNet121 (a pre-trained CNN model), fine-tuned for binary classification (healthy vs. diseased). The entire solution is packaged into a user-friendly web app using Streamlit, where users can upload leaf images and receive instant predictions along with precautionary advice or maintenance tips.

ðŸŒ¿ Sugarcane Leaf Disease Detection â€” Project Overview in Steps
Step 1: Data Collection
Gathered a dataset of sugarcane leaf images labeled as Healthy or Diseased.

Ensured the dataset covers different types of diseases for accuracy.

Step 2: Image Preprocessing
Standardized all images to the same size (224x224 pixels).

Applied normalization and data augmentation to improve model generalization.

Step 3: Model Selection and Training
Used DenseNet121 (a pre-trained deep learning model) for transfer learning.

Modified the final layers to suit binary classification.

Trained the model to distinguish between healthy and diseased leaves.

Step 4: Model Evaluation
Validated the modelâ€™s performance using testing data.

Achieved high accuracy and reliable disease detection.

Step 5: Web App Development
Built an interactive user interface using Streamlit.

Users can upload sugarcane leaf images through the app.

Step 6: Prediction and Feedback
The app analyzes the uploaded image using the trained model.

Displays whether the leaf is healthy or diseased.

If diseased: Shows a warning and suggests precautions.

If healthy: Confirms and provides tips to maintain plant health.

Step 7: User Interface Enhancement
Added a custom sugarcane logo to give the app a professional look.

Designed the layout for a clean, user-friendly experience.

âœ… Steps to Run the Sugarcane Leaf Disease Detection Project
Step 1: Open Google Colab
Visit https://colab.research.google.com.

Sign in with your Google account.

Step 2: Upload Your Project Files
Upload the following:

Your app.py file (Streamlit app script)

The trained model file (e.g., DenseNetSVM_Model.keras)

Any custom images like logos if needed

Step 3: Set Up the Environment
Install required Python libraries:

TensorFlow

Streamlit

Pyngrok

PIL (Pillow)

Step 4: Start the Streamlit App
Use the terminal commands inside Colab to:

Kill any previous Streamlit processes

Launch the Streamlit app (app.py)

Create a public URL using ngrok so you can access the app in your browser

Step 5: Open the Web App
Click the public link generated by ngrok.

The app will open in a new browser tab.

Step 6: Upload an Image
Use the upload button in the app to select a sugarcane leaf image.

Wait a few seconds for the model to analyze it.

Step 7: View the Results
The app will show:

A confidence score for disease prediction

A result message (Healthy or Diseased)

Suggestions or tips depending on the prediction

Step 8: Done!
You can test multiple images.
