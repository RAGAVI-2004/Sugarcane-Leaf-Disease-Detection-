# Sugarcane-Leaf-Disease-Detection-
This project focuses on identifying diseases in sugarcane leaves using a deep learning model. By analyzing images of sugarcane leaves, the model predicts whether the leaf is healthy or infected. It helps farmers and agricultural professionals detect plant diseases early and take preventive action to avoid crop loss.
